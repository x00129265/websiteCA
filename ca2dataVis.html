						<p>
						I'm young but responsible, respectable and hard working individual that loves putting in effort in things I'm doing yet at the same time I love enjoying life - travelling, being outdoors, eating abnormal amount of food, reading books, doing sports and spending time with family and friends are my greatest joys in life.
						</p>
						<p>
						I consider myself much more mature than my age actually is. I like being best and working hard to be the best at what I'm doing but at the same time I will be also the one that will motivate others to improve. 
						</p>
						<p>
						I choose IT sector fairly spontaneously yet I ended up loving it and now it is not just thing I do in college, at this stage it is a lifestyle. I love learning about technologies and analysing problems and only few things in the world gives you as much joy as the code that finally compiles without errors after weeks or months of hard work.

			<p><b>Introduction</b><p>
            <p>Did 8 month internship as a software developer.
                Developed 2 projects using programming language - Python which I learned while doing this internship.
                Picked up various IT skills as well as improved my communication skills, teamwork productivity and much more.
                Had an absolute blast working here. </p>
            <p><b>Week 1:</b></p>
            <p>On my first day I was more excited than scared about my first day. I was introduced to my team, they seemed open
                and kind. They told me what’s their job and how Ericsson in Athlone operates.
                I went to the monthly meeting on which I couldn't understand anything, yet I did my best to look smart... it was
                pretty challenging as I couldn't understand really what they’re saying. It was about statistic and they used a lot
                of abbreviations that I wouldn’t know. Later I figured that it's too early to consider a carrier in McDonald’s as
                my colleagues told me that it's normal. Later I figured out that most of those abbreviations and terms work only in
                the company like ENM, VCS, blades and others.
                I wasn't given much tasks to do on first few days, mostly I was just learning about company and tried to learn
                those abbreviations. Since day two I was attending daily scrums on which each member of team would say what they
                were working on the previous day and what they’re working on now.
                On week 1 I wasn't really able to say anything even if I did something it seemed like it’s not relevant to what
                others are doing. </p>
            <p><b>Week 2:</b></p>
            I was happy to find out that I will be working with python, so I was given task to self-teach it myself which I was
            happy about. Within a week I build up a pretty good basic, wrote some small interesting programs and tried to
            challenge myself as much as I wanted to progress as fast as possible to actually start doing something relevant.
            I wasn't scared to ask for advices on how to do things and what would my colleagues recommend me to do and they at
            least seemed like they are more than happy to help me, so I started to feel more comfortable with them.</p>
            <p><b>Week 3:</b></p>
            I found out what will be my first REAL job. They gave me a bash code which was showing daily checks on Ericsson
            system. My knowledge about bash was very limited so I had to quickly pick it up. Bash code that I was given was
            around 20 A4 pages big and I later figured also out that my code will be at least 10 times bigger in python in order
            for it to do same functionality as bash. They wanted me to do it because they wanted test cases for it. That gave me
            great and interesting challenge.
            I was consulting with person that wrote bash code and he gave me quick and good idea of what I need to achieve. That
            large code didn't seem as scary as it was at first glance but before starting writing code on day 3 I also asked for
            python expert to help me out and give me a greater idea of what I have to do from python’s perspective and he gave
            me clearer idea on where I should better start. Both of them were super helpful and nice to me. After that I started
            to work on the code.</p>


            <p><b>Week 4:</b></p>
            <p>Working fully on the code. Alongside with my code I have written tests for all my current methods. I try to
                follow all principles of a good programmer and since my program’s dealing with very large amount of data I try to
                make my code to run as fast as possible.
                Now I can follow much better on what’s going on in daily stand up meetings. I understand what they are doing. What
                are blades, clusters etc. There’s still a lot to learn but I'm doing my best to pick everything up as fast as I
                can.</p>

            <p><b>Week 5</b></p>
            <p>I feel like I’m very lucky to work with those people. They know their job well and I can learn from them so much.
                I'm not afraid to ask questions. Of course I don’t want to overwhelm them with some pointless questions and most of
                the answers I find using google yet they are super helpful and kind to me and since I'm the youngest member in a
                team I try share my positive energy in the office, of course within a limits and even thought it might sound
                unprofessional and not relevant, I think positivity in the office’s one of the keys to have a productive team, I
                even got friends with some outside the work, which kind of helps too since I don't know many people in Athlone. </p>

            <p>So far my program connects to the server via SSH keys and reads data from it. Data’s than handled by multiple
                processes and different data require to be handled differently before displayed. I included multiple test cases
                including unit-testing and mocking.</p>

            python expert to help me out and give me a greater idea of what I have to do from python’s perspective and he gave
            me clearer idea on where I should better start. Both of them were super helpful and nice to me. After that I started
            to work on the code.</p>


            <p><b>Week 4:</b></p>
            <p>Working fully on the code. Alongside with my code I have written tests for all my current methods. I try to
                follow all principles of a good programmer and since my program’s dealing with very large amount of data I try to
                make my code to run as fast as possible.
                Now I can follow much better on what’s going on in daily stand up meetings. I understand what they are doing. What
                are blades, clusters etc. There’s still a lot to learn but I'm doing my best to pick everything up as fast as I
                can.</p>

            <p><b>Week 5</b></p>
            <p>I feel like I’m very lucky to work with those people. They know their job well and I can learn from them so much.
                I'm not afraid to ask questions. Of course I don’t want to overwhelm them with some pointless questions and most of
                the answers I find using google yet they are super helpful and kind to me and since I'm the youngest member in a
                team I try share my positive energy in the office, of course within a limits and even thought it might sound
                unprofessional and not relevant, I think positivity in the office’s one of the keys to have a productive team, I
                even got friends with some outside the work, which kind of helps too since I don't know many people in Athlone. </p>
		
            <p>So far my program connects to the server via SSH keys and reads data from it. Data’s than handled by multiple
                processes and different data require to be handled differently before displayed. I included multiple test cases
                including unit-testing and mocking.</p>

							Tool that pulls data from servers -  categorizes and analyses data to give user a good view on how the systems are running, then added tests to present whether or not systems are in a good shape.</p>
							<p> Program was written by myself and I wrote it in python and bash. Best programming practices were applied. Tool is currently used at the company as well.

							Monthly reports that were generated by excel file took many hours or even days to be uploaded on Confluence (Tool that companies use to present various reports.) as the images had to be extracted, uploaded on right reports, and the reports had to be updated. I was asked to create tool that could automate this process.  
							</p>
							<p>
							I planned out my program, presented the idea and my team was happy with it so I had to build my first real GUI application. It took me around 2.5-3 months to make this tool which allowed reports from excel file to be just simply dragged and dropped on the right report pages. This tool allowed to reduce time spend on the process from days to 10 minutes and once again the tool is currently actively used in Company (It even went as far as India).

						<div class="content" style="padding-bottom: 0px">
							<p>
							There are thousands of online clothing shops, therefore my job was to work with a group of 3 people and make it better than others.
							To prove it we used our creative thinking and we came up with some brilliant ideas that other projects might not have. Our plan was to make website which will handle stock over different warehouses in different places (countries). Customer will be getting their product from the nearest warehouse where all the stock is handled. If nearest warehouse doesn't have enough stock - order will be made by main warehouse (if stock is divided over different warehouses in a way no warehouse can do order than other warehouses will send their product to the main warehouse from where the order will be made.)</p>
							<p>As our online quiz showed the biggest customer’s concern was the size of the clothes they would get if they will order them online. We came up with an alternative idea on how to fix that. What we want to offer customer is to let them give us their exact size parameters such as their shoulder width etc...
							Loyalty points which you can use later to buy products. Loyalty points also gave us opportunity to make an auction of our shop to make it more interactive.</p>
							<p>Shop also have all the basic functionality such as commenting on our products and using 'Like' button to show that they liked certain product. Admin and Warehouses are also interacting with the website differently.
